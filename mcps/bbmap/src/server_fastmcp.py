## Overview
BBMap is a fast, accurate splice-aware aligner for RNA and DNA. It can align reads from all major sequencing platforms.

## Basic Usage

### 1. Read Mapping
Map reads to a reference genome:
```
map_reads(
    reference_path="/path/to/reference.fasta",
    reads_path="/path/to/reads.fastq",
    output_sam="/path/to/output.sam"
)
```

### 2. Quality Analysis
Analyze read quality statistics:
```
quality_stats(
    fastq_path="/path/to/reads.fastq",
    output_prefix="quality_analysis"
)
```

### 3. Coverage Analysis
Analyze alignment coverage:
```
coverage_analysis(
    sam_path="/path/to/alignment.sam",
    reference_path="/path/to/reference.fasta",
    output_prefix="coverage_results"
)
```

### 4. Read Filtering
Filter reads by quality and length:
```
filter_reads(
    input_fastq="/path/to/input.fastq",
    output_fastq="/path/to/filtered.fastq",
    min_length=50,
    min_quality=20.0
)
```

## Common Parameters
- `additional_params`: Pass extra parameters like "minid=0.95 maxindel=3"
- Quality scores are typically in Phred scale (0-40)
- Length thresholds help remove low-quality short reads

## Output Files
- SAM files: Standard alignment format
- Stats files: Tab-delimited statistics
- Histogram files: Quality/length distributions

async def get_basic_workflow() -> str:
    """Get example BBMap workflow"""
    return """# Basic BBMap Workflow Example

This workflow demonstrates a complete read mapping and analysis pipeline:

## Step 1: Quality Assessment (Pre-mapping)
```python
# Analyze raw read quality
quality_result = await quality_stats(
    fastq_path="raw_reads.fastq",
    output_prefix="raw_quality"
)
print(f"Raw reads: {quality_result['quality_stats']['total_reads']}")
```

## Step 2: Read Filtering (Optional)
```python
# Filter low-quality reads
filter_result = await filter_reads(
    input_fastq="raw_reads.fastq",
    output_fastq="filtered_reads.fastq",
    min_length=50,
    min_quality=25.0
)
print(f"Filtered reads: {filter_result['filter_stats']['output_reads']}")
```

## Step 3: Read Mapping
```python
# Map filtered reads to reference
mapping_result = await map_reads(
    reference_path="reference_genome.fasta",
    reads_path="filtered_reads.fastq",
    output_sam="alignment.sam",
    additional_params="minid=0.95 maxindel=3"
)
print(f"Mapping rate: {mapping_result['mapping_stats']['mapping_rate']}%")
```

## Step 4: Coverage Analysis
```python
# Analyze alignment coverage
coverage_result = await coverage_analysis(
    sam_path="alignment.sam",
    reference_path="reference_genome.fasta",
    output_prefix="final_coverage"
)
print(f"Average coverage: {coverage_result['coverage_stats']['average_coverage']}x")
```

## Expected Results
- Quality stats show read length/quality distributions
- Filtering typically removes 5-15% of reads
- Good mapping rates are usually >80% for clean data
- Coverage should be relatively uniform across the genome
