# Execution Plan: list recursively add sequence files in the working dir

**Plan ID:** 5cf0c14d-2d0b-40a9-a8a4-b0adf3c88d61
**Complexity:** moderate
**Priority:** medium
**Status:** in_progress

## Description
This plan recursively identifies sequence files in the working directory and its subdirectories, confirms the list with the user, and then clarifies the ambiguous 'add' operation before proceeding with the appropriate secondary operation (not yet defined).

## Progress Overview
- **Overall Progress:** 0.0% (0/3)
- **Completed Steps:** 0
- **Failed Steps:** 0
- **Remaining Steps:** 2

## Success Criteria
- All sequence files in the working directory and subdirectories are identified.
- The user confirms the identified file list is accurate.
- The meaning of "add" is clarified and the appropriate secondary operation is performed successfully.

## Step Details

### 1. üîÑ Find Sequence Files Recursively

**Status:** in_progress
**Tool:** find_files
**Description:** Finds all files with common sequence extensions in the working directory and its subdirectories.
**Parameters:** `{
  "path": ".",
  "extensions": "fasta,fa,fna,fastq",
  "max_depth": "5"
}`

### 2. ‚è≥ Confirm File List with User

**Status:** pending
**Tool:** write_file
**Description:** Presents the list of found sequence files to the user for confirmation.
**Parameters:** `{
  "path": "found_sequence_files.txt",
  "content": "ANALYSIS_RESULTS"
}`
**Dependencies:** Find Sequence Files Recursively
**Expected Output:** A text file containing the list of found sequence files, ready for user review.

### 3. ‚è≥ Clarify 'Add' Operation (Manual)

**Status:** pending
**Tool:** None
**Description:** This is a manual step requiring user interaction to clarify the meaning of 'add'.  This step pauses execution until the user provides clarification.
**Dependencies:** Confirm File List with User
**Expected Output:** User clarification of the intended 'add' operation (e.g., concatenate, calculate total length, add to a list for processing).
