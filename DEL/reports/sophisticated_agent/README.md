# Sophisticated Agent Reports

This directory contains execution plans and progress reports generated by the Enhanced Universal MCP Agent.

## File Structure

- `plan.md` - Latest execution plan (updated in real-time)
- `plan_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md` - Timestamped execution plans
- `progress_N.md` - Progress reports for each iteration (N = iteration number)

## Report Types

### Execution Plans (`plan*.md`)
- **Goal and description** of the task
- **Complexity assessment** and priority
- **Step-by-step breakdown** with dependencies
- **Real-time status updates** as steps execute
- **Results and error tracking** for each step

### Progress Reports (`progress_*.md`)
- **Iteration summary** with progress percentage
- **Completed and pending steps** overview
- **Issues encountered** and adaptations made
- **Reflection notes** on execution quality
- **Estimated completion time** based on progress
