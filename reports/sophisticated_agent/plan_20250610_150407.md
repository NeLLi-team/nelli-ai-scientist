# Execution Plan: what sequence files are in data subdir

**Plan ID:** fbd488c1-45b1-451f-9ea8-44939708b48d
**Complexity:** moderate
**Priority:** medium
**Status:** in_progress

## Description
This plan identifies sequence files within the 'data' subdirectory. It uses the 'list_directory' tool to retrieve all files and then filters the results based on common sequence file extensions. This approach prioritizes speed and simplicity, acknowledging the potential for false positives due to non-standard extensions.

## Progress Overview
- **Overall Progress:** 25.0% (1/4)
- **Completed Steps:** 1
- **Failed Steps:** 0
- **Remaining Steps:** 3

## Success Criteria
- A list of files likely containing sequence data is returned.
- The list accurately reflects the contents of the 'data' subdirectory.
- The process handles potential ambiguities (e.g., non-standard extensions) gracefully.

**Result:** `{
  "step_id": "d6720ab5-8783-4395-8c8d-f58c8b6a266d",
  "step_name": "List Files in Data Directory",
  "tool": "list_directory",
  "parameters": {
    "path": "data"
  },
  "result": {
    "entries": [
      {
        "name": "nelli_hackathon",
        "type": "directory",
        "size": null,
        "modified": 1749578666.831537
      }
    ],
    "path": "data",
    "count": 1,
    "success": true
  },
  "error": null
}`

### 2. ⏳ Filter for Sequence Files

**Status:** pending
**Tool:** find_files_by_pattern
**Description:** Filters the list of files based on common sequence file extensions.
**Parameters:** `{
  "path": "data",
  "extensions": "fasta,fastq,fa,gb,faa,fna"
}`
**Dependencies:** List Files in Data Directory
**Expected Output:** A filtered list containing only files with extensions associated with sequence data.

### 3. ⏳ Handle Empty Directory

**Status:** pending
**Tool:** write_file
**Description:** Checks if the list of sequence files is empty and provides a message if so.
**Parameters:** `{
  "path": "../../reports/sequence_files_report.txt",
  "content": "No sequence files found in the 'data' directory."
}`
**Dependencies:** Filter for Sequence Files
**Expected Output:** A message indicating that no sequence files were found, written to a report file.

### 4. ⏳ Write Sequence File List to Report

**Status:** pending
**Tool:** write_file
**Description:** Writes the list of identified sequence files to a report file.
**Parameters:** `{
  "path": "../../reports/sequence_files_report.txt",
  "content": "ANALYSIS_RESULTS"
}`
**Dependencies:** Filter for Sequence Files
**Expected Output:** A report file containing a list of identified sequence files.
