## Progress Summary

- **Completed Steps:** 0/3
- **Failed Steps:** 1
- **Steps In Progress:** 0

## Completed Steps

## Issues Encountered
- ‚ùå Step 'Get Directory Path from User' failed: File not found: user_input.txt

## Adaptations Made
- üîÑ Retried step 'Get Directory Path from User' 3 times

## Reflection Notes
- The step failed to achieve its intended purpose of getting a directory path because it couldn't read the "user_input.txt" file.
- The issue is that the file "user_input.txt" doesn't exist, or the tool doesn't have access to it.
- This failure halts progress as the next steps likely depend on the directory path, requiring a resolution before proceeding.
